# edujupyter

## Brief description

This project consists of resources for teaching various disciplines 
(Mathematics, Physics, Engineering) using the jupyter notebook format. 
We believe that this format is ideal both to communicate information to 
students, and also to encourage them to "play" with data and programs 
to achieve a better understanding of the underlying principles.

Example resources are offered here in .ipynb files, that may be 
downloaded and used in a Jupyter notebook environment, either locally 
hosted or remotely on a server. In this sense, the original Jupyter 
server at http://www.jupyter.org is recommended as a computing 
platform accessible from simple devices such as tablets, since using 
the notebook environment is possible without installing any software. 

Please note that Github offers direct integration of .ipynb files with 
its web interface: thus notebooks in this repository may be accessed 
directly from the project web interface with no need for downloading. 
We see this as a great example of open-source technology projects 
interfacing to create a rich learning environment that promotes 
student participation in their own learning process. However, be warned 
this option does not work as well as executing the notebook directly 
on a Jupyter of your choice; in case of difficulties, please do not 
hesitate to actually download the .ipynb files and proceed from there.
